//6 clickable photos/objects.  each is a different cuisine.
//var: model (name ?)
//{name: chinese, american, mexican, vegan, indian, japanese}
//need event click for each photo, which will hide the other (not-clicked) photos, and produce link options for restaurants and recipes.

//the api's will have a set parameter to fetch  5 results for restaurants and 5 for recipes.
//the results produced for restaurants will come from the API (yelp) parameter based on 
//restaurant location, rating, name, dollar sign and price range
//the results produced from recipe api (food2fork) based on 
//recipe title, rating, image, link to full recipe and ingrediente (?)

//the onclick function will be a for loop, running through each of the objects


//need a config var, it will come from the database created through firebase.  both API keys also need to be stored there
//need need to intialize the app {var database = firebase.database()}
